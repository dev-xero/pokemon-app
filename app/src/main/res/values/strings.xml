    <!-- POKEMON DESCRIPTIONS -->
    <string name="bulbasaur_description">
        There is a plant seed on its back right from the day this
        Pokémon is born. The seed slowly grows larger.
    </string>
    <string name="ivysaur_description">
        When the bulb on its back grows large, it appears to lose
        the ability to stand on its hind legs.
    </string>
    <string name="venusaur_description">
        Its plant blooms when it is absorbing solar energy.
        It stays on the move to seek sunlight.
    </string>
    <string name="charmander_description">
        It has a preference for hot things. When it rains,
        steam is said to spout from the tip of its tail.
    </string>
    <string name="charmeleon_description">
        It has a barbaric nature. In battle, it whips its fiery
        tail around and slashes away with sharp claws.
    </string>
    <string name="charizard_description">
        It spits fire that is hot enough to melt boulders.
        It may cause forest fires by blowing flames.
    </string>
    <string name="squirtle_description">
        When it retracts its long neck into its shell,
        it squirts out water with vigorous force.
    </string>
    <string name="wartortle_description">
        It is recognized as a symbol of longevity. If
        its shell has algae on it, that Wartortle is very old.
    </string>
    <string name="blastoise_description">
        It crushes its foe under its heavy body to cause fainting.
        In a pinch, it will withdraw inside its shell.
    </string>
    <string name="caterpie_description">
        For protection, it releases a horrible stench
        from the antenna on its head to drive away enemies.
    </string>
    <string name="metapod_description">
        It is waiting for the moment to evolve. At this stage,
        it can only harden, so it remains motionless to avoid attack.
    </string>
    <string name="butterfree_description">
        In battle, it flaps its wings at great speed to release highly
        toxic dust into the air.
    </string>
    <string name="weedle_description">
        Beware of the sharp stinger on its head. It hides in grass
        and bushes where it eats leaves.
    </string>
    <string name="kakuna_description">
        Able to move only slightly. When endangered, it may stick
        out its stinger and poison its enemy.
    </string>
    <string name="beedrill_description">
        It has three poisonous stingers on its forelegs and its tail.
        They are used to jab its enemy repeatedly.
    </string>
    <string name="pidgey_description">
        Very docile. If attacked, it will often kick up sand to
        protect itself rather than fight back.
    </string>
